# Order Database Storage Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds complete order storage functionality to the checkout process. When customers place orders via WhatsApp, the order details are first saved to the database, allowing the admin to view and manage all orders from the admin panel.

## Database Structure

### Orders Table
The `orders` table stores the main order information:
- `id` - Order ID (auto-increment)
- `customer_name` - Customer's full name
- `customer_email` - Customer's email address
- `customer_phone` - Customer's phone number
- `total` - Order total amount
- `status` - Order status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- `items_count` - Total number of items in the order
- `shipping_address` - Full shipping address
- `billing_address` - Full billing address
- `notes` - Optional order notes
- `created_at` - Timestamp when order was created
- `updated_at` - Timestamp when order was last updated

### Order Items Table (NEW)
The `order_items` table stores individual items in each order:
- `id` - Item ID (auto-increment)
- `order_id` - Foreign key to orders table (cascade on delete)
- `product_name` - Name of the product
- `option_name` - Selected product option/variant
- `quantity` - Quantity ordered
- `price` - Unit price
- `subtotal` - Item subtotal (price × quantity)
- `image` - Product image URL
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp

## Implementation Details

### 1. OrderItem Model
**File:** `app/Models/OrderItem.php`

Created a new model to represent individual order items with:
- Mass-assignable fields for all item attributes
- Type casting for numeric fields (quantity, price, subtotal)
- `belongsTo` relationship with Order model

```php
public function order()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
}
```

### 2. Updated Order Model
**File:** `app/Models/Order.php`

Added relationships and query scopes:

**Relationships:**
```php
public function items()
{
    return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::class);
}
```

**Query Scopes:**
```php
// Search orders by customer info
public function scopeSearch($query, $search)

// Filter orders by status
public function scopeByStatus($query, $status)
```

### 3. CartController Updates
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/CartController.php`

#### New createOrder() Method
Handles order creation from checkout form:
1. Validates form data (name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip)
2. Retrieves cart from session
3. Calculates order totals
4. Creates order record in database
5. Creates individual order item records for each cart item
6. Returns JSON response with order ID and WhatsApp phone number

```php
public function createOrder(Request $request)
{
    // Validation
    $request->validate([...]);
    
    // Get cart and calculate totals
    $cart = Session::get('cart', []);
    $total = $this->calculateTotal($cart);
    
    // Create order
    $order = Order::create([...]);
    
    // Create order items
    foreach ($cart as $item) {
        OrderItem::create([...]);
    }
    
    // Return success with order ID
    return response()->json([...]);
}
```

#### Updated showCheckout() Method
Added WhatsApp settings to pass phone number to the view.

### 4. Checkout View Updates
**File:** `resources/views/pages/checkout.blade.php`

#### JavaScript Updates
Modified the "Place Order" button handler to:
1. Save order to database via AJAX POST request
2. Wait for successful order creation
3. Include order ID in WhatsApp message
4. Open WhatsApp with pre-filled message
5. Redirect to home page after 2 seconds

**Key Changes:**
- Changed button click handler to `async` function
- Added `fetch()` call to `/orders/create` endpoint
- Updated WhatsApp message to include `*Order #${result.order_id}*`
- Added error handling with user-friendly alerts
- Button shows "Processing Order..." during submission

### 5. Admin Orders View Updates
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`

Updated `showOrder()` method to eager load order items:
```php
public function showOrder($id)
{
    $order = Order::with('items')->findOrFail($id);
    return view('admin.orders.show', compact('order'));
}
```

### 6. Order Details View
**File:** `resources/views/admin/orders/show.blade.php`

Added new "Order Items" section that displays:
- Item image (or placeholder if no image)
- Product name
- Option/variant name
- Quantity
- Unit price (₦)
- Item subtotal (₦)

```blade
@if($order->items->count() > 0)
<div class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-amber-200">
    <div class="px-6 py-4 border-b border-gray-200">
        <h2>Order Items ({{ $order->items->count() }})</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="px-6 py-4">
        @foreach($order->items as $item)
        <!-- Item display card -->
        @endforeach
    </div>
</div>
@endif
```

### 7. Routes
**File:** `routes/web.php`

Added new POST route for order creation:
```php
Route::post('/orders/create', [CartController::class, 'createOrder'])->name('orders.create');
```

## User Flow

### Customer Checkout Flow
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Customer navigates to checkout page
3. Customer fills in billing and shipping information
4. Customer clicks "Place Order via WhatsApp"
5. **Order is saved to database**
6. Order ID is generated
7. WhatsApp opens with pre-filled message including Order ID
8. Customer sends message to business WhatsApp
9. Page redirects to home
10. Customer receives confirmation

### Admin Order Management Flow
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/orders`
2. Admin sees list of all orders with:
   - Order ID
   - Customer name and email
   - Item count
   - Total amount
   - Order date
   - Status
3. Admin clicks "View" on an order
4. Admin sees complete order details including:
   - Customer information
   - Shipping and billing addresses
   - **Complete list of order items with images and prices**
   - Order summary and totals
   - Order timeline
5. Admin can edit order status or details
6. Admin can delete pending orders

## Benefits

✅ **Complete Order History** - All orders are stored in the database for record-keeping  
✅ **Better Order Management** - Admin can track, search, and filter orders  
✅ **Detailed Item Tracking** - Each product in an order is individually tracked  
✅ **Order Reference** - WhatsApp messages include order ID for easy reference  
✅ **Customer Service** - Admin can look up orders by customer name, email, or order ID  
✅ **Inventory Management** - Track which products and variants are being ordered  
✅ **Sales Analytics** - Historical data for sales reporting and analysis  
✅ **Status Tracking** - Monitor order lifecycle from pending to delivered  

## Currency Display

The system now uses Nigerian Naira (₦) throughout:
- Order totals in admin panel: $295.83 (system uses $ in database)
- Order items display: ₦14.99, ₦74.97, ₦183.96 (Nigerian Naira in frontend)
- WhatsApp messages: ₦ symbol for consistency

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Order is created in database when "Place Order" is clicked
- [x] Order includes all customer information
- [x] Order items are saved with correct details
- [x] WhatsApp message includes order ID
- [x] Admin can view order in orders list
- [x] Admin can view full order details
- [x] Order items display correctly with images and prices
- [x] Order status shows correctly
- [x] Currency symbols display correctly (₦)

## Database Migration

Run the migration to create the `order_items` table:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Migration file: `2025_10_25_210414_create_order_items_table.php`

## Technical Notes

- **Cascade Delete**: Order items are automatically deleted when parent order is deleted
- **Decimal Precision**: Prices stored with 2 decimal places (10,2)
- **Foreign Key Constraint**: `order_id` in order_items references `id` in orders table
- **Model Relationships**: Proper Eloquent relationships for easy data access
- **Query Optimization**: Eager loading with `Order::with('items')` prevents N+1 queries
- **Session Management**: Cart remains in session until explicitly cleared
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for failed order creation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all form fields

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email confirmation after order creation
- SMS notifications for order status changes
- Order tracking number generation
- Inventory deduction on order placement
- Order export to CSV/Excel
- Advanced filtering and search
- Order analytics dashboard
- Customer order history page
- Automatic order status updates via WhatsApp webhook
- Payment integration
- Multiple shipping addresses
- Order cancellation with refund tracking
